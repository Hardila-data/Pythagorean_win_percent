<p> This notebook has the calculation of a pytegorian win percentage of the 2018 premier league season, it will be compare to the win percentage to determine if there is a relaci√≥n between them. Also, there will be a implementation of linear regression using te Stocahastic Gradient Descent to optimize the loss function.
<p>The data used in this notebook was taken from <a>https://www.football-data.co.uk/books.php</a> by joseph buchdahl.The implamentation of linear regression model was made based on the information in the WebSite "Real Python" <a>https://realpython.com/gradient-descent-algorithm-python/</a>. The Pythagorean win percentage topic is explained in <a>https://www.coursera.org/learn/prediction-models-sports-data/</a></p>
